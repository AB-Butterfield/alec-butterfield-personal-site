## Alec Butterfield's Personal Website
Hi there, my name is Alec Butterfield, and welcome to my website! This site serves as my Web Development Portfolio, as well as a running journal of my journey as a developer. I've separated the website into the following pages:

## Home 🏠
"Home" is the splash page for my website. It features a short description of who I am and what I do. 

## Projects 🖥️
"Projects" is the page that encompasses all of my past Web Development projects. This page also utilizes the HTML "i-frame" element, which allows the user to view the deployed websites live from within the "Projects" page. For all active websites, there is also a link included that leads to the deployed websites.

## Goals 📰
The "Goals" page narrates the future goals for my website. This includes updates for all of the other pages, as well as some personal goals I'd like to achieve.

## Gizmos ⚙️
"Gizmos" is reserved for my smaller projects, such as testing React components or demonstrating niche tasks that I've solved. In the future, I plan to include the ACE Code Editor with this page and to give the user the power to copy my code and test it live themselves.

## Contact ☎️
"Contact" is a simple page that includes the different ways prospective clients and employers may reach me. This includes my LinkedIn, GitHub, and Email.


## Technologies used 🛠️
This website primarily uses the React.js library and Node.js. It is driven by the JavaScript language and uses HTML5, CSS, and LESS. I plan to add to this stack OpenAI/ChatGPT, Express.js, and TypeScript.
