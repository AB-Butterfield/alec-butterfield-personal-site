        whoAmI: `My name is Alec Butterfield. I have worn many hats over my lifetime, from a server and 
        manager of a Korean restaurant to a customer sales rep at a holiday ornament company,
         to a video game designer as a student in college. From these vastly different experiences, 
         three truths tie them together. I love science. I love art. I love combining the two in ways no 
         one’s ever thought of. Ever since I discovered my love for website development in early 2022,
          I’ve been on a roll diving deeper and deeper into the coding thicket that is web dev. 
          Thanks to an accelerated Fullstack boot camp, I’ve been able to hone these skills to their
           maximum potential, and I’m excited to tackle every project that comes my way! Let’s built a
            beautiful and efficient future together!`,
        whatDoIDo: `I am a Fullstack Engineer, primarily working with Frontend Development. 
        I have experience with HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, React.js, Node.js, Express.js, Gitbash, and LESS.
         Currently, I am an Online English Teacher Trainer, but I’m excited to break into the development
          world as a Junior Web Developer. `
